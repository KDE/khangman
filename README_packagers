****** At the attention of packagers *******

You MUST ship KHangMan at least the default English data so that 
the user can play with the program. The program is designed to start with 
the default data which is in /kdeedu/khangman/data.
DO NOT SPLIT this data from KHangMan please!

--------------------------------------

In the scripts/ folder you will find a Ruby script which will extract all
KHangMan svn data from l10n-kde4 in KDE svn, using anonsvn.

The data will be tarred for each language and a tarball
<iso>.tar.bz2
will be made, where <iso> is the language ISO code used by KDE.

You can use this script for producing additional data for KHangMan if you want.
In a custom folder, simply copy the script and run:

ruby khangmanl10n.rb

A sub-folder khangman-data/ will be created and the tarballs will be in it.

You only need to be connected to the internet!

Have fun,

Anne-Marie
