****** At the attention of packagers *******

KHangMan depends on /kdeedu/data/kvtml

You MUST ship KHangMan with at least the default English data which is in kdeedu/data/kvtml.

--------------------------------------

In the scripts/ folder you will find a Ruby script which will extract all
KHangMan svn data from l10n-kde4 in KDE svn, using anonsvn.

The data will be tarred for each language and a tarball
<iso>.tar.bz2
will be made, where <iso> is the language ISO code used by KDE.

You can use this script for producing additional data for KHangMan if you want.
In a custom folder, simply copy the script and run:

ruby khangmanl10n.rb

A sub-folder khangman-data/ will be created and the tarballs will be in it.

You only need to be connected to the internet!

Have fun,

Anne-Marie
