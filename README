To run the game from cvs:
make -f Makefile.dist
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
su -c "make install"

The game installs in /usr/local/kde if the prefix option is not invoked (run
/usr/local/kde/bin/khangman to start it).
In that case, the pics don't appear, you have to copy them in /usr/share/icons.
This will be fixed soon.
