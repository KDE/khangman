KHANGMAN - NEW IDEAS - NEW DESIGN

11 April
- center the word display
- choose font in configuration (3 dialogs: for Misses, for word and for Guess+charWrite)
- Misses and word font the same? (uniformity prefered by Dannya)
- make the gradient disappear in minimum size so that the added parts merge exactly
- change the wording of Misses to Mistakes? (Reuben)

07 April 2005 
- urgent: implement Desert theme DONE 10 April
- urgent: reimplement the moveNear() method from KPassivePopup to control position of the passive popups
- implement fontChecker for Domestic Manners and Dustimo Roman in main.cpp
- find a way to end a game (when you lose or when you win -> special animation?)

22 March 2005
Menubar
- Look menu -> switching theme DONE 10 April 
- Language menu -> switching language DONE 10 April

Options - themes

- DONE sea theme: the "light" to blink when changing animations...
in practice, there would be a bg image with the light on, and one with the light off...
maybe we overlay just the light part on a standard bg
- preview theme is Settings dialog

we could write the options if needed in some kind of theme file (Dannya)

NEW: Young kids theme with 120x120 pixels area to put an image -> new kvtml file with pic name as hint

DONE Misses and Word and Guess: QPainter for each theme

Toolbar for special chars and normal: transparent image bg for one
