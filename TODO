- implement fontChecker for Domestic Manners and Dustimo Roman in main.cpp
- check font size in several configurations
- find a way to end a game (when you lose or when you win -> special animation?)

22 March 2005
Menubar
- Look menu -> switching theme
- Language menu -> switching language

Options - themes

- DONE sea theme: the "light" to blink when changing animations...
in practice, there would be a bg image with the light on, and one with the light off...
maybe we overlay just the light part on a standard bg
- preview theme is Settings dialog

we could write the options if needed in some kind of theme file (Dannya)

NEW: Young kids theme with 120x120 pixels area to put an image -> new kvtml file with pic name as hint

DONE Misses and Word and Guess: QPainter for each theme

Steve font: free? -> dual licensing DONE (GPL)

Toolbar for special chars and normal: transparent image bg for one
