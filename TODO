KHANGMAN - NEW IDEAS - NEW DESIGN

USABILITY questions that might remain

- KPassivePopup for tip: good solution? tip appears always at the same place, where ever you click. Is that good? Should the tooltip appear where the user clicked instead?
- usability of the Configure KHangMan dialog


11 April 2005
- center the word display
- better position the passive popups
- choose font in configuration (3 dialogs: for Misses, for word and for Guess+charWrite)
- Misses and word font the same? (uniformity prefered by Dannya)
- make the gradient disappear in minimum size so that the added parts merge exactly
- change the wording of Misses to Mistakes? (Reuben)

Menubar
- Look menu -> switching theme DONE 10 April 
- Language menu -> switching language DONE 10 April

Options - themes

- DONE sea theme: the "light" to blink when changing animations...
in practice, there would be a bg image with the light on, and one with the light off...
maybe we overlay just the light part on a standard bg
- preview theme is Settings dialog

we could write the options if needed in some kind of theme file (Dannya)

NEW: Young kids theme with 120x120 pixels area to put an image -> new kvtml file with pic name as hint

DONE Misses and Word and Guess: QPainter for each theme

Toolbar for special chars and normal: transparent image bg for one
